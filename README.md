## About
This repository is related to the Kaggle competition: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)

In this competition, it is given a dataset ([train.csv](https://github.com/viniciusov/titanic-survivors/blob/master/train.csv)), with the survivors indications, and you must predict the output of a desired dataset ([test.csv](https://github.com/viniciusov/titanic-survivors/blob/master/test.csv)), if each person will survived or not.

## Analysis
You can check my analysis in the [Titanic Jupyter-notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/viniciusov/titanic-survivors/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb).

It's a little bit tricky to deal with some features (some of them has more than 77% of missing values), but you can visualize the whole process to fill in these missing values.

## Results
This [Titanic Jupyter-notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/viniciusov/titanic-survivors/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb) gave me a score of 0.79425 (which means that it can predict 79.725% of the desired dataset correctly) and put me on the top 19%.

If you consider that there are a lot of cheaters (some of them can get a 100% score, which is verly unlikely in a event like that because random actions can interfer in the survival rate), it is a pretty decent score. Also, you can find the complete datasets with a quickly internet search. 

I'm not sharing my final file (submission.csv) to avoid anyone just take it and submit to Kaggle, but you can run the code to get it easily.
